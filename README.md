Introduction:

	In this project you will add methods to an existing linked list class

Description:

Modify the author's(Mark Allen Weiss) "MyLinkedList" class to add the following methods:
	
	a) swap
	    receives two index positions as parameters, and swaps the nodes at
		  these positions by changing the links, provided both positions are 
		    within the current size
	
	b) shift
	    receives an integer (positive or negative) and shifts the list this
		  many positions forward (if positive) or backward (if negative).  
		    1,2,3,4    shifted +2    3,4,1,2
		    1,2,3,4    shifted -1    4,1,2,3
	
	c) erase 
		receives an index position and number of elements as parameters, and
		  removes elements beginning at the index position for the number of 
		    elements specified, provided the index position is within the size
		    and together with the number of elements does not exceed the size
	
	d) insertList
		receives another MyLinkedList and an index position as parameters, and 
		  copies the list from the passed list into the list at the specified
		    position, provided the index position does not exceed the size.
	
	e) main
		add code to the main method to demonstrate each of your methods
